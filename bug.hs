This Haskell code suffers from a space leak because of its use of the `State` monad. The state is accumulated in the `loop` function without being explicitly dropped. This leads to a linear memory growth, which can eventually exhaust available resources.

```haskell
import Control.Monad.State

loop :: Int -> State [Int] Int
loop 0 = return 0
loop n = do
  s <- get
  put (n:s)
  x <- loop (n - 1)
  return (x + n)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = evalState (loop 100000) []
  print result
```
